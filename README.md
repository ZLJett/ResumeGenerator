General design principle here is that switches are added only for items I want to drop, i.e.  If including an item at all, it will necessarily have title, position, location, dates, etc. BUT I will want to choose if I want, highlights, links, summary etc. 

Reason for using front matter variables over config variables is can use --livereload to tweak things easier 

OLD Structure idea:
  section data: in _data - controlled by _config.yml switches, all default to base options
  section structure: in _includes - controlled by _config.yml switches, all default to base options
  resume structure: in the index.html - controlled by _config.yml switches, all default to base options
  resume style - controlled by _config.yml switches that are hand set

GOAL: Idea of this is that the base/short resumes are my generic resumes, after that all other directories are designed for individual companies/positions resumes. When I go to create those my GOAL is that a resume folder is just its own _data files (i.e. changed data). All minor structure changes should be accomplishable with switches from that individual resumes's index.html file's front matter variables. However any major changes can have possibly _includes, _sass, content.html, or index.html files  (i.e. changed structure).
Further, my GOAL for the system is that it can dynamically detect all new files in the resume folder, be they _data, _included, _sass, etc. and use those for the project, with any missing files being pulled from default. So all I have to do is supply a list of resume elements and it will pull all the changed ones for this resume first and fill in the rest with the defaults. 


# Resume Creation Steps:

Resume is made up of three layers of Switches:
1. Section Data Entry Switches: each relevant resume entry, i.e. a project's summary or highlights, has an inclusion switch that is part of the _includes file, i.e. the section template, for that Resume Section, i.e. _includes/defaultSectionTemplates/projectsTemplate. All switches are set with a front matter variable and each section template ensures if the front matter variable is not included then all data that exists in the data file (i.e. all filled entries), will be included in the HTML generated by the template.
2. Section Entry Switches: each resume section entry, i.e. Master of Arts or Calculator Webpage,  has an inclusion switch that is part of the _includes file, i.e. the section template, for that Resume Section, i.e. _includes/defaultSectionTemplates/projectsTemplate. All switches are set with a front matter variable and each section template ensures if the front matter variable is not included then all section entries will be included in the HTML generated by the template. 
3. Resume Element Switches --- these are do I include projects or do do I include conteact info swtiches that are on index.html page and controled by frontmatter varibles 





OLD - NAMES HAVE CHANGED 
section structure: in _includes - controlled by _config.yml switches, all default to base options
resume structure: in the index.html - controlled by _config.yml switches, all default to base options
resume style - controlled by _config.yml switches that are hand set


## Setup:
This section covers all additional files that must be created to make a new resume:
* ***Alternative Resume Style***: To give a resume its own style in addition to, or other than, the default style (i.e. "_sass/defaultStyle.scss") create a new scss file with the styles you want and place it in a _sass directory under the directory of the resume you want the special style for.
  This file can have any name, but my convention is resumenameStyle.scss, see for example testStyle.scss under the _testResume directory. 
  How this file is selected for use is covered in Step 2 of _config.yml setup. 


## Config:
In the _config.yml file the following decisions MUST be made: 
* ***Select Target Directory***: You must first select which resume you want to generate by targeting its directory.In _config.yml, in the TARGET section change second item under "include" (marked with the same line comment "#Target") to the resume directory you want to generate page from i.e. _baseResume or _shortResume.

If all settings are set to their "default" values (commented next to the option as "#default:") a standard base resume will be generated. However, the following aspects of the generation can be changed from the default:
* ***Alternative Resume Style***: If the resume is to be generated with any other style than the default (either additional styles or a completely new style) you must complete the following steps: 
  1. ***Add the Resume's Style Directory***: First, in the CHANGE STYLE section you must add the load path of your additional/replacement scss file to the list in the first option, "load_paths," under the "sass" option. This load path is the file(s) under the _sass directory of the target resume directory, for example testStyle.scss under the _testResume directory is added as so: [_resumes/_testResume/_sass].
  NOTE: the "load_paths" option only allows for the loading of scss 'partials' from other places than the "_sass" directory in root. It does not add them the generation. That is done in the next sub-step.
  2. ***Add the Additional Stylesheets***: Second, any additional/alternative stylesheets for this resume MUST have their names included under the "style-list" config variable. 
   If you wish to use additional stylesheets alongside the default stylesheet set the "additional_styles:" option to "true." Alternatively, if you whish to replace the default stylesheet and use only one(s) specific to that resume you must set the "replace_default_style:" option to "true."
   

## Static
things I mean to permenatnatly leave alone, e.g. like the default layout, which contains no page data just the head info and such needed for a 'website' all page content will come from index.html so I will not need any child/other layouts.
