// STATIC: This file adds all all the stylesheets used to add style to any given resume, 
// but what stylesheets are added is done in the root _config file. Hence, this file 
// itself is STATIC and should never need to be modified. For exactly how this file works 
// see the README and the _config.yml file.
// NOTE: This file MUST be SAVED WITHOUT FORMATTING, shortcut: 
// first, "ctrl + k" then, "ctrl + shift + s"
