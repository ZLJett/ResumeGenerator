        "summary": "A financial trade routing system built for a practical development exercise designed by a senior developer who worked in that industry. It was built in a Java/Camel based tech stack and supported: XSLT based XML conversion, JPA/Hibernate based database management, JSON based application configuration, and a JUnit based testing suite. As part of the exercise, I was wholly responsible for designing the routing application, including the evaluation, selection, and integration of 3rd party technologies.",
