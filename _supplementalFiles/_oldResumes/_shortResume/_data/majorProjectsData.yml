    summary: "Engineered a resume generator using Jekyll and Liquid for automated, 
      job-specific resume creation. This tool leverages an orchestrating Bash script 
      with unique applications of Jekyllâ€™s systems pushing Jekyll far beyond its normal 
      function. It intelligently detects and integrates resume-specific HTML, CSS, and 
      data into the default configuration. Content is fully configurable from a single 
      source, permitting dynamic inclusion, exclusion, or reordering of elements."

    takeaways:
    technologies:
    summary: "A financial trade routing system built for a practical development
      exercise designed by a senior developer who worked in that industry. It was
      built in a Java/Camel based tech stack and supported: XSLT based XML
      conversion, JPA/Hibernate based database management, JSON based application
      configuration, and a JUnit based testing suite. As part of the exercise, I
      was responsible for designing the routing application, including the
      evaluation, selection, and integration of 3rd party technologies."
