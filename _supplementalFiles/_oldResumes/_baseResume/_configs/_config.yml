### Resume Config File ###
# This Resume _config.yml file MUST be included with below AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED 
# variables in each resume directory in its _configs directory for CreateResumes.sh to be 
# able to add config variables
# Config Notes:
#    "DEFAULT VALUES" listed before each config variable show settings for generating a 
#     resume with default contents.
#    "STATIC" marked config variables should NOT be changed

# HAND SET CONFIG OPTIONS:
# All config variables in below section are not automatically generated and must be changed by hand

# RESUME CONTENT AND ORDER: This is the list of Element Templates used by defaultContents.html 
# to generate the Resume. This is usually STATIC but this option allows for switching to a 
# different Resume organization without deleting the previous one.
# NOTE: This list is the ORDER THE elements will appear in on the Resume. Element order can 
# ONLY be changed from here!
# NOTE: The "resumeTitleTemplate" and the "contactInfoTemplate" are not included here as they
# are added together as DEFAULT content by resumeHeadTemplate.html
default_resume_contents: [resumeHeadTemplate, summaryTemplate, skillSetsTemplate, projectsTemplate, minorProjectsTemplate, certsTemplate, educationTemplate, professionalBackgroundTemplate, communityServiceTemplate, awardsTemplate]

# GOOGLE FONTS: Set any google fonts that need to be added as a <link> tag inside the 'webpage' <head>
# in the "defaultHeadContents.html" template. 
# Args: the link option is the link for the 'href' link provided by google fonts in their automatically 
# generated <link> tag, while the name option is not used and is only there for improving readability. 
google_fonts:
  - name: "Lusitana"
    link: https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lusitana&display=swap

# AUTOMATICALLY SET CONFIG OPTIONS:
# Config variables that are automatically generated by CreateResumes.sh.

# RESUME SOURCE DIRECTORY: Item marked "# Source Resume Directory" sets what resume is being generated.
# This will change where the "index.md" page is sourced while still allowing access to all the 
# directories in root.
# ARG: Resume Source Directory is the name of any directory in the "_resumes" directory
include: 
- _resumes
- _baseResume    # Resume Source Directory

# RESUME DATA FILES: All resume specific Data files, i.e. modified Data, in the resume's "_data" directory
# ARGs: file names in resume's _data directory without extension and MUST be in double quotation marks,
# e.g. ["contactInfoData"]
# DEFAULT VALUE empty list, i.e. []
modified_resume_data: []

# RESUME TEMPLATE FILES: All resume specific Templates files, i.e. modified Templates, in the 
# resume's "_includes" directory
# ARGs: file names in resume's _data directory without extension, e.g. [resumeTitleTemplate] (Note:
# these do not need to be in double quotation marks).
# DEFAULT VALUE empty list, i.e. []
modified_resume_templates: []


# CHANGE STYLE OPTIONS: 
# These are automatically generated by CreateResumes.sh based on user inputs and the contents of 
# the "_sass" directory.

# These options set what stylesheets are used for the resume by setting the @imports in  the "styles.scss" 
# file. This file sets the "main stylesheet" as the first included, then any "additional stylesheets" in 
# alphabetical order after that.
# CreateResumes.sh by default sets "replace_default_style:" to "false" (and then sets the "main_stylesheet:" 
# option to the default "defaultStyle.scss" stylesheet) and "additional_styles:" to "true". 
# When "replace_default_style:" is set to "true" the "main_stylesheet:" option is set to the user input to
# CreateResumes.sh. Note: the "load_paths:" option below will be set to the "_sass" directory of the resume 
# so that the new main stylesheet can be drawn from the resume's styles directory (note however no "additional 
# styles" will be included by this changes as it does not change the
# "additional_stylesheets:" option in any way).
# DEFAULT VALUE: "false"
replace_default_style: false
# When "additional_styles:" is set to "true" all resume specific style files in the resume's "_sass" directory
# are added to the "additional_stylesheets:" option below
# DEFAULT VALUE: "false"
additional_styles: true

# MAIN STYLESHEET: This is the first stylesheet included by "styles.scss" and is intended to contain the
# bulk of the resume's style content. This file is either intend to be "defaultStyle.scss" or a file in 
# in the resume's "_sass" directory (hence why the "load_paths:" option below will be set to the "_sass" 
# directory of the resume when "replace_default_style:" is set to "true").
# ARG: the name of a stylesheet either in the root or the resume's own "_sass" directory, without file extension.
# DEFAULT VALUE: "defaultStyle", e.g. "defaultStyle.scss" is included as "defaultStyle"
main_stylesheet: defaultStyle

# PRINT STYLESHEET:  This is the last stylesheet included by "styles.scss" and is intended to contain just
# the style content necessary to adjust the base resume style seen in the preview webpage to match the final
# print-to-PDF output. This file is either intend to be "printStyle.scss" or a file in 
# in the resume's "_sass" directory (hence why the "load_paths:" option below will be set to the "_sass" 
# directory of the resume when "replace_default_style:" is set to "true").
# ARG: the name of a stylesheet either in the root or the resume's own "_sass" directory, without file extension.
# DEFAULT VALUE: "printStyle", e.g. "printStyle.scss" is included as "printStyle"
print_stylesheet: printStyle

# The "load_paths" option allows for the use of stylesheets, i.e. "scss partials" outside of the root "_sass"
# directory, but this option does not actually change what will load. What is loaded is determined by the 
# @include statements in "assets/css/styles.scss" which are set by the other style options in this config file.
# DEFAULT VALUE empty list, i.e. []
sass:
  load_paths: [_resumes/_baseResume/_sass]    # AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED
  sass_dir: _sass    # STATIC
  style: compressed    # STATIC

# RESUME ADDITIONAL STYLESHEETS:All resume specific style files, i.e. additional styles, in the
# resume's "_sass" directory are added by CreateResumes.sh when above option "additional_styles:" 
# is set to "true".
# Note: CreateResumes.sh will automatically list these items in alphabetical order and thus this
# is the order in which their styles will override each other. So care needs to be taken in style 
# file naming if a specific order is desired.
# ARGs: the name of a stylesheet in the resume's "_sass" directory, without file extension, e.g.
# "additionalStyle.scss" is included as "additionalStyle"
# # DEFAULT VALUE empty list, i.e. []
additional_stylesheets: []
