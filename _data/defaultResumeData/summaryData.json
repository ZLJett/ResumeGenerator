  "summary": "I am a self-taught software developer who switched to programming after completing a M.A. History. I enjoy taking apart algorithms and heuristics to see how they work and figure out how to apply them to something completely different. I am excited to work with industry veterans with hard-won advice to share, improve my knowledge with real-world projects, and develop creative engineering solutions to real challenges."
