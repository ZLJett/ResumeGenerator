  summary: I am a self-taught software developer who switched to programming after
    completing a M.A. History. I enjoy taking apart algorithms and heuristics to
    see how they work and figure out how to apply them to something completely
    different. I am seeking to get into a job where I can get feedback from
    experienced developers, improve my knowledge with real-world projects, and
    learn creative engineering solutions to real challenges.
