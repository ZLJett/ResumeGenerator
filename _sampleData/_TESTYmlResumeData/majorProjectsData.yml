    summary: "TEST TEST TEST A financial trade routing system built for a practical development
      exercise designed by a senior developer who worked in that industry. It was
      built in a Java/Camel based tech stack and supported: XSLT based XML
      conversion, JPA/Hibernate based database management, JSON based application
      configuration, and a JUnit based testing suite. As part of the exercise, I
      was wholly responsible for designing the routing application, including the
      evaluation, selection, and integration of 3rd party technologies."
